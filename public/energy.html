                    <h3>Why Care About Clean Energy?</h3>
                    <p> A reliable energy system underpins all sectors, from businesses to healthcare, 
                        education, and technology. While access to electricity is improving in poorer countries, 
                        energy efficiency is advancing, and renewable energy is expanding, significant challenges remain. <br><br>
                        About 2.3 billion people still lack clean cooking fuels and technologies, causing severe health and
                        environmental harm. Fossil fuels, the dominant energy source for decades, contribute heavily to climate
                        change and global well-being risks. Rising global electricity demand makes stable energy supply critical
                        for economic growth. <br><br>
                        Without electricity, essential services like healthcare, education, and business development suffer, 
                        disproportionately affecting women and children. If clean cooking solutions are not prioritized, nearly a 
                        third of the global population will remain exposed to harmful air pollution by 2030. <br><br>
                        To achieve universal energy access by 2030, we must accelerate electrification, invest in renewable energy, 
                        enhance efficiency, and implement supportive policies and regulations.</p>

                        <li>Governments: Accelerate the transition to sustainable energy by investing in renewable resources, 
                            energy-efficient practices, and clean technologies.</li><br>
                        <li>Businesses: Commit to sourcing 100% renewable electricity and protecting ecosystems.</li><br>
                        <li>Employers: Reduce transport demand by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivizing 
                            energy-efficient travel methods like trains.</li><br>
                        <li>Investors: Support sustainable energy services and diverse suppliers to fast-track new technologies.</li><br>
                        <li>Individuals: Save energy by using power strips and turning off appliances completely when not in use. 
                            Opt for biking, walking, or public transport to cut carbon emissions.</li><br>

                    <h3>Facts and Stats</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Progress in Energy Access: <br> 
                            Global electricity access rose from 73% in 1998 to 91% in 2021, yet 675 million people, 
                            primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, remain without electricity.
                            Access to clean cooking fuels improved globally, from 64% in 2015 to 71% in 2021, but 2.3 billion 
                            people still rely on polluting fuels, with sub-Saharan Africa showing the least progress.<br><br>
                        </li>   
                        <li>Renewable Energy:<br>
                            Renewable sources now power nearly 30% of electricity consumption.
                            Significant challenges persist in applying renewable solutions to heating and transport sectors.<br><br>
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>Investment Gaps:<br>
                            Developing countries see 9.6% annual growth in renewable energy installations.
                            However, international financial flows for clean energy are declining.
                            Achieving universal electricity access requires $35 to $40 billion annually through 2030.<br><br>
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>Future Goals:<br>
                            Accelerate electrification, expand renewable energy investments, improve energy efficiency, and 
                            establish supportive policies to meet the 2030 energy access targets.
                            Without faster progress, 660 million people will lack electricity, and 2 billion will still use 
                            unsafe cooking fuels by 2030.<br><br>

                        investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology</li><br>

                        <li>By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services 
                        for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and
